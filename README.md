# Lenskart-scraper
A simple webscraper made in python that I made for a very specific purpose. Add links of lenskart products to the 'links' text file and It'll create a csv file of the products. You can also get the images of products if needed.

# Dependancies
You'll need Python and Beautiful soup to run this

# How To Use
Enter links of lenskart products into the links.txt folder(make sure not to leave any whitespace)
Run main.py and wait for the links to finish being scraped.
Open the output CSV file and enjoy. Run imgdownloader to download images from the links(of the products). You need to download firefox and have geckodriver in PATH for it to work.
